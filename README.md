Goop's Story
============
In a far away galaxy lived the Goops in a small planet with no moons, those small cute creatures lived in peace, they had a very easy way of living, they found food easily in nature and they had caves as shelters, they lived smiling all day long. Their planet was very rich in natural recourses but they never knew how to use it.

Those little beings with a limited intelligence didn’t even know what the world around them meant they were seeing everything beautiful with their big beautiful eyes and they had a very strange attraction to all that glitters or brightens…

But one day inhabitants of another planet discovered the Goops planet and they colonized it, the gentlest ones made the Goops their pets but the meanest ones transformed them to slaves to serve them or to lab rats for their weird experiences.

The legend says that far away in a beautiful white Galaxy there was a very bright planet and if ever one Goop gets to put a foot on it, he’ll become the strongest creature in all Universe. And that one day a lucky goop will find that planet and will become that strongest creature and he’ll come to save all Goops from the nasty aliens who colonized it.

One day a group of bad aliens decided to explore the Milky Way they heard a lot about it but none of them visited it before. Of course they had to take at least one Goop to serve them...

When they got close to our solar system and especially to earth, their space shuttle started to make troubles. They couldn’t continue to navigate and after a bad move things got worse, the shuttle got out of control they tried their best but no result they were crashing!

A few days later they woke up surrounded by big pills of scrap… They looked around, remembered that they were crashing on earth. They tried to assess the damage and see if they’re all still alive while they discovered that Goop was not there…

At that moment Goop was far away from them he was exploring this new land he found himself in, he was in a large forest, nobody was around him and he could discover at his ease the new kind of brightness and colors he had never seen before. It was a real delight for his beautiful eyes.

When the sun was about to set the moon started to appear, Goop was blown away by this beautiful bright object in the sky and his eyes became to get bigger and bigger till he had that vision!

It was like a dream, he saw himself jumping to the moon and being transformed to a big strong creature and then jumping again to his planet where everybody met him with a big smile in their face and all what happened in that war against the evil aliens passed before his eyes… he knew it was him who had to save all the Goops..

Now he had to find a way to get there, bounced once, then twice… then tried again and again till he understood that he cannot reach it like, he is not strong enough for now and that he had to find something to jump on, looked around and found some tree trunks, wood planks and other stuff here and there on the ground.

But he needs help to build all those things together that’ll make him jump high till he gets to the moon.

And he’s going to needs help to fight the monsters who are going to find him soon… and try to prevent him to reach the moon by breaking all what he’s jumping on…

Goop is the kind of games that has a very simple concept but that makes you so addicted that you can’t stop playing once you tried it once.

The rules are very simple, the big aim of the game is to make Goop (the main character) jump as high as possible in the sky. (Until he reaches the moon, but no one can really does that :D)

The score is measured in meters.

Goop bounces all along the game, different kinds of objects fall from the sky on the right side of the screen the player has to build these objects or bricks together (by dragging them simply) so that goop jumps on them.

Every object has its size and fragility it breaks after goop jumps on it a few times… that’s why the player has to be as fast as possible… and has to choose wisely the objects to use.

From time to time bonuses can fall to help goop make a long jump or to protect the bricks.

Enemies come from the left side to try to make goop fall. A canon is there to kill them…

The keys “Z” and “S” help to position the canon and the “D” key to send a bullet... once again the player has to be careful, a wrong shot can break everything.

It’s all about reaching the highest score, players get more attached to the game as more as they play it!
